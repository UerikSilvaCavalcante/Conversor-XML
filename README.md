üîÑ XML File Converter
Python

The "XML File Converter" project is a powerful tool developed in Python to convert XML files into various formats, such as JSON, CSV, or other custom formats. This project aims to facilitate the manipulation and integration of data stored in XML with other applications and systems.

Features:

üìÇ Format Conversion: Converts XML files to popular formats such as JSON and CSV, allowing integration with systems that do not use XML.
‚öôÔ∏è Custom Settings: Offers options to customize the conversion, such as field selection and data transformation.
üõ†Ô∏è Command Line Interface: Utilizes a simple command-line interface to ease usage and automate the conversion process.
üîç Data Validation: Checks the integrity and validity of XML files before conversion to prevent errors and ensure data accuracy.
Technologies Used:

Python: Utilizes libraries such as xml.etree.ElementTree for XML manipulation and json or csv for export to other formats, and the Pyside6 library for the graphical interface.
CLI (Command Line Interface): Developed for efficient operation directly in the terminal.
How to Use:

Prepare Your XML File: Ensure your XML file is correctly formatted.
Run the Converter: Use the command-line interface to start the conversion:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
python conversor_xml.py -i input.xml -o output.json -f json
-i: Input XML file.
-o: Output file.
-f: Output format (json, csv, etc.).
View the Converted File: Access the output file in the chosen format.
Objective of the Project:

The main goal of this project is to provide an efficient and flexible solution for converting XML files to other formats, facilitating data integration and interoperability between different systems. It is ideal for developers and data analysts who need to manipulate and transform XML data in a practical and reliable way.
